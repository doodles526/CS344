For my algorithm I chose to implement a Segmented Sieve of Erotasthenes as documented here: http://programmingpraxis.com/2010/02/05/segmented-sieve-of-eratosthenes/

Note: The equation the use in finding the offsets in that link for each segment is wrong, so I made up my own.

My program has 3 main sections, a master, a set of workers, and a printer.

Setup:
Determine how many numbers each process/thread will work on.
Determine the size of the bit array(note: I wanted to ovoid having to use locks so I could speed up the program, to do this I needed to have each process/thread have ownership of an entire range of char*'s without overlap. in order to free up space, I halved my space complexity by only having bits represent the composite/prime state of odd numbers)

start up all the nescessary workers.
Start up the printer.
Start the master.

Join/wait

Roles:
Master:
	The master calculates all the primes between 1 and the sqrt of MAX_PRIME.  As the master finds primes, it sends them in a pipe to each of the workers. 
	Finally, after sending all the primes between1 and sqrt(MAX_PRIME), the master iterates over the primes it is responsible for, and sends all twin-primes over a pipe to the printer.


Worker:
	Each worker works over a range of (MAX_PRIME - sqrt(MAX_PRIME))/num_concurency numbers.
	What information each worker knows:
		The base of the bit_array for it to work on(this is relative 0)
		The starting number it is analyzing
		The number of numbers it is to analyze
		All the primes < sqrt(MAX_PRIME) as provided through a pipe from the master
		The pipe to send all twin-primes to the printer.
	
	When a worker receives a prime from the master, it first determines the offset to the first divisor of it, relative to the starting number.  
	It then marks all the multiples of the prime in it's section of the bit array.

	After marking all the non-primes, we iterate through our list of primes, and send the twin-primes to the printer.

	To achieve additional speedup, since we know that all twin primes except 3-5 are of the form (6n-1, 6n+1) we only check values of that form for consideration

	Since every worker has ~ the same range of numbers to analyze, all operations are run against a relative 0(the base of bit_array passed in), and all have roughly the same number of operations to perform, the work is very evenly distributed. As can be shown in my best time running prime_pthread at MAX_PRIME with 30 threads at 35 seconds.


Printer:
	The printer is passed an ordered array of pipes.  It simply reads all the data from the pipes, one pipe at a time, and prints it.  Note: This part is absolutely the largest bottleneck! Without this aggregrator and printing directly from each worker, I was able to find MAX_PRIME in under 7 seconds, however with this my time increased to the high 30's and low 40's
