Revision Control Systems are pieces of software which help in managing bodies of code.  Typically they have the ability to save the state of a project, and freeze that state onto a tree of all the other past saved states.  For example in git, one would issue a commit.  That commit would be saved onto the commit tree.  And if for some reason you needed to undo some changes, or bring back a feature that was trashed in an earlier commit, you can simply iterate up the tree and bring back the old code.  

Revision control systems are useful in many ways.  In my personal experience, the best argument for revision control is when working in a group of people on a project.  Keeping a central revision control sytem prevents costly errors found when one is emailing files, or working on a shared NFS disk.  Revision control protects this sensitive code from the temptation of copy-paste from file to file, avoiding out of date files, and ultimately keeps everyone from working on old-code if used properly.

A few examples of Revision Control Systems include git, svn, cvs, and darcs.  Fun fact: OSU's very own Dr. David Roundy is the creator, although not current maintainer of darcs.

Commands:

git:
git init # initializes the git repository
git push origin master # pushes the current repo(all the data in the local commit tree) onto the remote named origin and branch master and merges the two together on the remote
git pull origin master # pulls the remote repo named origin(all the data in the remote commit tree) onto the local repo and merges the two together

svn:
svn checkout URL_PATH # pulls the svn repo found at the URL_PATH and creates a local svn repo
svn update # pulls the remote svn repo, and merges it with the local svn repo
svn add FILE# adds the given file or changes in the file to the svn tree

darcs:
darcs init # initializes the darcs repo
darcs add FILE # tells darcs to start tracking the file
darcs whatsnew # informs you of any unrecorded changes to tracked files
