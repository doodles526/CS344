Assignment 6


Unfortunately due to extreme business the last couple weeks I was unable to finish(or come close to finishing) the assignment.

I tried my best to make the shell and work inward so you have as much to grade on as possible as far as grasping my knowledge base is concerned.
However, the only working item currently is running compute with the -d debug option and providing a max number to search for perfect numbers.
